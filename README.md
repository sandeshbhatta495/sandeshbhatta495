# 👋 Hey there, I’m Sandesh Bhatta (@sandeshbhatta495)

**🚀 Aspiring Engineer | Python Developer | IoT Innovator | Automation Craftsman**

> *“From the hills of Nepal to the heart of innovation, I build tech that matters.”*

I’m an Electronics, Communication & IT undergraduate at Tribhuvan University—one of the few but fierce first-generation engineers from a remote region, striving to blend **hardware precision with software power**. Armed with curiosity, I break down complex systems and rebuild them smarter.

## 🧠 What Drives Me

- 🚦 **Automating the mundane** with Python, Selenium, and IoT
- 📈 **Extracting truth from data** using Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn
- 🌐 **Scraping the web** for structured insights
- 🛠️ **Designing systems** with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Fusion 360
- 🎨 **Creating interfaces** that users actually *enjoy*
- 📚 **Learning & iterating** like my life depends on it (because it does)

## 🚧 Featured Projects

### 🔹 Task Manager
A SQLite-powered CLI app in Python that helps users **track, categorize, and complete tasks**. Built for minimalism, optimized for speed.

### 🔹 Banking Management System
Secure, modular, and practical banking app with login authentication, transaction history, and a clean dashboard. Your money’s digital watchdog.

### 🔹 Pizza Order System
Yes, I built a pizza bot. 🧀 Choose size, crust, toppings. Get total cost + taxes + order ID. **No human errors. No cold pizzas.**

### 🔹 Student Result System
Robust student-grade platform with CSV exports and authentication. 📊 No more Excel nightmares for teachers.

### 🔹 Rock-Paper-Scissors (Python)
Fun CLI game with **color-coded UI**, scoreboard, and AI opponent logic. Turns idle time into battle time.

### 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis
From **Diwali sales** to **urban traffic**, I’ve cleaned, visualized, and interpreted datasets with Pandas, Seaborn, and Plotly. 📈

### 🔹 Web Automation & Scraping
Using Selenium + BeautifulSoup to collect data and **generate insight at scale**. Automated emailers, task runners, and scraping pipelines also included.

## 🔥 Fun Fact

> I don’t just write code. I design **intelligent systems** that solve real-world pain points—whether it’s a cluttered UI, inefficient workflows, or noisy sensor data. When I’m not shipping code, I’m probably sketching circuits, watching tech breakdowns, or playing sports to reset my mind.

---

## ⚙️ Repo Philosophy

Every repo I push is a **launchpad**—documented, organized, and ready for the next dev to fork, extend, and build upon. I believe in code that speaks for itself—*clean, modular, and resilient.*

---

## 🙏 Final Note

I’m not just learning—I’m leveling up.  
Let’s connect, collaborate, or just geek out about the beauty of well-written code, minimal UI, and automating life itself.
